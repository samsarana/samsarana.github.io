[some kind of short introduction]
How many problems to discuss?
Maybe just three?
1 Beware the will-o’-the-wisp!
In English folk tales, the will-o'-the-wisp is a ghostly light, seen by travellers at night. Because it recedes as travellers approach, it earned an infamous reputation for leading astray the curious or confused.

In my nighttime travels through the treacherous terrain of RL, I was enticed by two such receding targets. Firstly, I intended to get in touch with the authors of some related work, which I expect would have resulted in some invaluable guidance. Before doing so, however, I felt a need to “prove myself” by making a solid start with the project, and having something to show for it. But of course, the target of “having something to show for it” receded as I approached---and so I never sent the email.

Secondly, I was enticed by the light of “being seen to be making good progress” by my supervisor. So, when I inevitably encountered setbacks, I avoided meeting with my supervisor until I was “back on track”. But of course, by the time I’d resolved the setback, the criterion for “back on track” had moved along, and so I worked furiously to try to catch up. Sometimes this worked, but more often I got stuck again while chasing that target---and so the cycle repeated---until I was “embarrassingly” behind and hadn’t spoken to my supervisor for weeks.

What could I have done differently? If I had pre-committed to sending the email at the end of week 3 of my research, or pre-committed to regular check-ins with my supervisor, then I wouldn’t have had to chase the receding, ghostly light of my own self-worth. [maybe a bit too much]
